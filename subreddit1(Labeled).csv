0,Dissociation  I don t think I can live long like this,1,pv7hh6,Venting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/pv7hh6/dissociation_i_dont_think_i_can_live_long_like/,0,2021-09-25,I feel hopeless  I ve been suffering from anxiety disorder since college  Last year  I ve started suffering from a bad health anxiety  I started having panic attacks  Then just recently  I started having this fear of going insane  I started dissociating which makes my anxiety panic worse  I feel like I m losing control and that the reality is slipping    Now  health anxiety and dissociation when combined are the worst  I go from thinking I m going insane to thinking I m going insane   probably because I have a tumor which I know I don t because I had a normal brain MRI a year ago  Still  I m eager to get another brain MRI just to be sure    Also  I m always light headed  My head feels empty and also heavy almost all the time  I feel like  I m only half focused aware  When I walk I feel like I walk weird and that everything is fuzzy  And when I read  I have to try harder for the sentences to register in my head  I mean I understand them but I forget them right away  It scares me so much that the panic anxiety is almost constant  Any slight movement can trigger my anxiety  So far  I never had hallucinations  But this combination of extreme fears is making me feel like I m gonna go insane  It s so exhausting and depressing  I want to give up on life so bad  I can t take this anymore     can someone please give some advice  I ll be starting my meds tomorrow  It s for anxiety and depression  I haven t told my doctor about dissociation because it s just recently

3,Huge anxiety and stress at new work assignment  How to handle ,2,pv75s0,Work/School,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/pv75s0/huge_anxiety_and_stress_at_new_work_assignment/,0,2021-09-25,Hi all  I work as an IT data specialist consultant at a consultancy firm in a western European country  Now currently I am one week into a new assignment where I m seconded to a company and it is absolutely making me mentally stressed out  even now on the weekend constantly thinking about work  ruminating all the time  not being able to sleep  highly emotional  to the point that it is making me physically ill  headaches  waking up with a knot in my stomach  fatigued etcetera   It is my second assignment after having been seconded about   years to another company   Now personally  I think there are a number of factors contributing to this     First one is probably the biggest and is within myself  in that I m quite anxious by nature and new job situations are always tricky to me unless I know that the job at hand is one that I can handle      with my skills or I can at least get by with a bit of learning  This anxiety is something I m planning on getting professional help with  but right now that anxiousness is all too prevalent and not helping    Second is that the  first  project I was put on at this new company requires knowledge of a tool unknown to me  I am the only specialist that is going to work on that part  so I don t really have someone to work with who can guide me  Also this project has a tight deadline that I doubt I can make under these circumstances  I think my seniority in this was overestimated  since it s a whole new game as oppossed to what I did before    Third is that even with this project going which is already probably hard to complete by the deadline  a flock of people is coming to me to ask me to help on their projects  which is also a lot to handle   Now I m feeling shit the whole time  even when I m off of work  I told my manager at my consultancy firm the problems that I was encountering and also the stress and physical symptoms it is causing me to have  He was very understanding and trying to accomodate to make the new place work for me  He also said that they d stand behind me and that if things didn t work out  they would search something else for me   This made me feel a bit more relaxed for a while  but after that it has been non stop worrying and feeling bad again for me  Now I m quite worried that if I go on like this  it will have longer lasting effects on my health   As I see it now  it s just too much for me given my current mental state  Is it too much to ask from my employer to take me off the assignment and find a more fitting easier one for me  Given that I ve been a good  loyal and hard working employee before  Never sick  making the clients happy  During this time of an easier assignment I want to go to a psychologist to handle the anxiety I have  to avoid these things in the future   This has become a bit of a rant but I m just kind of losing it here and am afraid of my mental state right now   
4,Advice needed for partner s imagined medical anxiety   Potential medical trigger ,1,pv73kh,Advice Needed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/pv73kh/advice_needed_for_partners_imagined_medical/,0,2021-09-25,I  M    am married to an anxious person  F     She is anxious because of an abusive childhood  and it manifests in a lot of different ways  She does a lot of catastrophizing and the worst is her imagined medical issues  She will stub her toe and think it will result in her having to have her leg amputated which will result in me leaving her which will result in her death  etc  Her main trigger is imagined cancer    If her shoulder hurts  if her side hurts  if her chest hurts  if she has period cramps  if she has a headache  etc  anything will make her think it s secretly cancer and she is      going to die  We know that she behaves this way as a way to protect herself  to keep her  alert  of a threat  We also know some of the anxiety might be alleviated by regular physical check ups  but of course we re American and thus don t have health care   She also has some issues with medical situations doctors that also causes anxiety    We are working on the doctor situation  but I know that won t solve everything since we can t just go to a doctor for every bruise and stomachache   She loses a lot of sleep every night fantasizing about how she s dying  how this is the last four hours of her life  how I ll react when I wake up to her dead  or how I ll react if she has to go through cancer treatments  etc   etc   etc  She knows she shouldn t think about stuff  but she is incapable of turning off her brain  She will obsess about things for days  and then the cat will playfully bite her and she ll obsess about dying from a cat bite for the next few days until the next thing captures her imagination   She is already in therapy  and she has specifically talked to this therapist  and other  past therapists  about this issue  So far  none of them have given her any useful ways to deal with these intrusive thoughts  She is also incapable of googling how to fix stuff like this because just googling stuff will implant a new fear into her head   I m sure some of you know how it is    What can I do to help  What can she do to help  There are nights she gets very little sleep because she s up all night thinking she s having a heart attack or whatever  which only makes her anxiety worse when she has to get up early for work  etc   It is really stressful for me  too  both because I can t help  and because I feel like my partner isn t present because she s obsessing over imagined illnesses   Any help is appreciated  thanks   PS this is my first time posting here  If there is a better place for me to post this  please just let me know 
5,Not so fun story,1,pv72nf,Venting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/pv72nf/not_so_fun_story/,0,2021-09-25,I been having anxiety and depression problems since my early teens     now  and for the past few months felt better than ever with no meds or anything until I injured my eardrum few weeks ago    I can handle pain quite well that was not a problem  not fun either but manageable  The real horror started with vertigo  got an inner ear inflammation because of the eardrum problem that gave me constant dizziness  lightheadedness and nausea  and of course my old friend anxiety kicked in and been having constant anxiety and panic attacks since then  After the ear cleared out i had chest tightness and tingling in left arm  so I freaked out even more and went to A E  and after blood samples  x rays of heart and lungs everything was in perfect condition so the doctor told me it s my anxiety  I felt better the same day  but then in next few days i started filing tingling in my left cheek  and last night tingling in arm and face got worse  started getting worried and panic attack kicks in wit a headache and shortness of breath and trouble concentrating on whatever people are telling me in that moment so I  make another trip to the A E with the same result  but without x ray or mri because doctor was so confident it s just stress and anxiety  as he explaind me if it was something more serious  i would loose muscle feeling so my face would droop  and I wouldn t be able to move my hand    I had million panic attacks and anxiety issues over the years but they ve never gave me such physical symptoms that lasted for days and weeks  so whoever is reading this  go and check yourself out definitely   but don t panic  because if you think it s your head it probably is

95,Discovered my dad is the root of my anxiety   cutting him out of my life   need advice or hear from someone who has gone through a similar situation,5,puwm6p,Family/Relationship,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/puwm6p/discovered_my_dad_is_the_root_of_my_anxiety/,1,2021-09-25,I have struggled with panic anxiety disorder and ptsd for a while now  In      I got a really bad panic anxiety attack and thought something was wrong with my heart  That year there were a lot of visits to the emergency room  hospitals and my doctor  They suspected something could be wrong with my heart  and had to have a   h EKG a couple of times  and they did an ultrasound of my heart  Nothing turned up  and my heart was healthy  No one thought to suggest that it could be anxiety  so I went on with my life and it stopped for a while  Turns out I had a lot of minor anxiety attacks after this  and then it got really bad again in December last year  This was hands down my worst panic anxiety attack ever     x   B   Since then I went to a see a therapist  We found out that a lot of my anxiety attacks were because how my then stepmom treated me  She was verbally abusive all the time  and in some cases she was even physically abusive  This is were my PTSD stems from  I would for example get anxiety attacks if someone opened the door too fast  like she did  because that sound meant she was coming to scream at me   For a while I thought the root of my anxiety was her  cause I get really stressed if I think I m doing something the wrong way etc  So I knew the PTSD and the fear of doing something the incorrect way was because of her  but I still felt something was missing  It didn t explain all of my anxiety     x   B   Recently I discovered that the root of my anxiety is my dad  That was when everything clicked in place  My mom said I have always been an anxious kid  The most annoying thing was that I always had to go to the bathroom no matter where we were and what we were doing  when my stresslevel is really high  I have to go to the bathroom really bad and often     My dad always put work before anything else  So from when I was around   years old  my dad would go to work before I usually woke up and come home late at night when I was asleep  If I wanted to see him  I had to wake up without an alarm clock or without my dad waking me up  I remember I always woke up in a panic and was really afraid that he was gone and would get out of my bed as fast as I could  run down the stairs and look out the window to see if his car was gone  If the car was gone  I would just cry hysterically for a really long time  and there was little my mom could do to calm me down  He was usually home on sundays but he didn t really spend much time with me   When I was   up to   or   years old  before my parents slipt up  he would sometimes drive me to school and my siblings to kindergarden  I remember I just wanted to talk to him when he did this  but he was always on the phone the whole time and told us not to interrupt  I would often get so mad that I just walked away from him and walked to school myself  It took him a while to notice I was gone  If I didn t walk away  he would usually forget to drop me off at school  I was the last kid he would drop off   so he just drove right past it while on his phone  Then he would get mad at me for not reminding him that I was still in the car     x   B   When I was around   years old  my parents had split up and he was living by himself  We would spend time at his place every other weekend and every thursday  But those days were often cancelled because he had to work or just wanted to go out partying instead of spending time with us  When we were there  he was usually talking on his phone due to work  so we wouldn t really get to spend time with him  I would often get so mad that I ran away  and would often find a spot where I could see the road to see how long it would take before he noticed I was gone and went out looking for me  It usually took around an hour or two    Sometimes my dad would take us places  but it was usually because he was doing activities with his friends  often paintball   and we just had to sit and watch them play for a couple of hours  and then he was back on his phone     x   B   When I was    he got together with my then stepmom and quickly moved in with her and her two kids  Her kids always ruined our things  ran after us with swords or knives and just generally hurting us  her son for example broke my sister s arm and knocked out a tooth   Our then stepmom started to verbally abuse us pretty quickly and I told this to my dad several times  He refused to listen and just told me that I was exaggerating or that I just misunderstood the whole situation  I remember my mom eventually set up a meeting where my dad had to show up so that I could voice my concerns  He got really angry  said that he refused to listen to it and just stormed off  After this my dad told me I had to apologize to my then stepmom and needed to be nice to her  I had to live with them until I was    when I moved away  From I was   to    I tried several times to tell my dad how my then stepmom was but I was shut down as quickly as all the other times I did  In this time period I also tried to tell my grandmom  my father s mom  what was going on  but she too refused to listen  When I told my friends about the situation  or my boyfriends  they all said I was exaggerating and refused to believe me    In my teenage years I got pretty wild  and could pretty much do whatever I wanted without my dad questioning me why I was out all night or what I was doing  I could come home drunk and he wouldn t do much about it  I realize now that this was pretty much a cry for help and trying to get him to notice me    My then stepmom would also be verbally abusive right in front of him  and he would just ignore the situation and didn t do anything about it    I moved out when I was     but my then stepmom and my dad was my boss  so from    to    years old  I had to deal with her while I was on work  I needed the money      x   B   So I realize now where my insecurities come from and why I have anxiety and why I had the need to be noticed or acknowledged  Now I get a panick attack every time my stresslevel goes up and I can get a panick attack from pretty much anything  not just specific things     From    years old to now     years old  he hasn t been good at reaching out  asking me how I m doing and stuff like that  I rarely see him and I rarely speak with him  I realized all this for just a couple of days ago  I have now decided to cut him out of my life  based on something that happened this week  Last week he said he was coming to my town for a job meeting  and he made plans to go out to eat with me while he was in town  Two days before he was supposed to come to my town  I saw on snapchat that he and his family  his new girlfriend and their two kids  was traveling here  I didn t hear anything from him the first day they were in town  and I didn t hear anything from him the second day either  And then I saw on snapchat that they have gone home  I didn t hear a word from him  We had plan for the next day and I knew then that our plans would not happen  as usual  He often comes to my town for job meetings but never think to let me know  and the few times he does  he cancels on me   Then the day came  and I heard nothing  Today I got a message from him where he straight up lied to me  explaining that he hadn t traveled to my town and that the travel was cancelled because of the storm  the storm came in the afternoon the day we had plans  not the two whole days while he actually were in my town      x   B   I honestly feel really angry and disappointed at this moment  I ve decided to cut him out of my life cause this is too toxic for me  and he doesn t respect me  I ve also discovered that he has been talking trash about my fianc   whom he has met briefly a few times  I ve realized that after    years I m just done trying to get my dad s attention and affection  I m just done  And I realize that this means that I will probably lose contact with my grandmother  because she thinks my dad can do no wrong and refuses to listen if we tell her something she doesn t want to hear about him  This whole situation has driven my anxiety to go haywire     Sorry for the long post  I just had to get it out      Has anyone else been in a similar situation  I would love to hear it  or just general advice cause at the moment I feel like I m being a huge asshole for doing this  Thanks

,1,putz0g,Venting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/putz0g/therapist_of_only_one_session_has_caused_me_a_lot/,4,2021-09-24,Context  I became very sick yesterday with a cough cold  I slept most the day and the other half I spent worrying about work and money if I had    days off with COVID isolation  I m on  hr   I forgot to text him about my symtoms for my  nd session today  I know that s my fault  I realised at  am and had a mini panic and texted him  With me being sick half daze panic  and because I m also used to NHS services  it just didn t click with me he d have to take me off the wait list as he can only have a certain number of patients    I m so embarrassed and guilty that not only did I forget to text him  but I feel that he thinks I have only apologised to get my own way  back on his wait list   To be fair  I don t actually remember signing a contract  and he didn t tell me about his policies in the first session    I would have been fine to pay the fee for this session if he asked me  or even if he explained to me that I needed to be taken off his list for now as it was late notice  But he didn t really explain what his policies are  he just kind of did it leaving me confused   My anxiety is sky high  I feel an enormous amount of guilt and I don t want to be on this shitty planet any more  I also feel annoyed that he went from   to     and wasn t softer about his approach    Oh he also called me poor in the first session     oh you re a support worker  you re poor  which was meant as a joke but I was still a bit like    He offered me    off     in which I was equally appreciative and insulated   Now I just hate myself for not looking at the red flags  for letting him know about not being able to attend too late  not understanding the fact I have been taking off his client list  and the way I ve allowed this to affect me so much       ME  Hi  Unfortunately I have covid symptoms so won t be able to make it in today  Can we rearrange once my PCR test is back please    HIM  Hi  I ll offer today s appointment to those waiting  Please get in touch when you don t have symptoms    ME  Hiya  PCR came back negative  I still have symptoms of a cold but feeling ok  It s up to you whether i should come in  I m available Wednesday   th or Thursday   th next week or Monday  th or Thursday  th the week after  If not  I will message you when my symptoms have completely gone    HIM  Hi  I ll contact you when I have availability as I ve had to offer your space to someone on the waiting list   ME  Ah ok  no problem   ME  I m sorry I m a bit confused after rereading  has my entire spot on your list been replaced  Sorry I don t mean to be rude I m just confused   HIM  Hi  sadly   I can t keep future appointments open when someone is unable to say when they can  can t see me  As was our case    So someone had the session you and I had booked    At      they asked for a sesssion next Friday  As I didn t have anything back from you I said yes  I wasn t expecting you to notice Covid symptoms and get a PCR test all within a   hour timeframe to be honest    So they were able to start therapy at     pm today  You weren t   to the best of my knowledge  at     pm able to start   So yes  this person has taken the available session space  I hope this clarifies   ME  I m so sorry it was such short notice   I was so poorly yesterday  afternoon I just slept   I m just a little confused as to why I can t book another session   If someone replaces one of my sessions  which was obviously fair enough   do they replace my spot on your client list  Sorry I hate to ask  HIM  Hi  who is the greatest of respect  If you knew you couldn t attend a session yesterday because you re so poorly and had Covid symptoms  it would ve been very helpful for me to have known that yesterday   ME  No I know I am really sorry  I got ill quite quick and was asleep from  pm   midnight  It just slipped my mind at midnight too with me still feeling very under the weather   HIM  Hi  I run a small business I  that employs three people  It is important that I maximise the sessions that are available  Despite the late notice  I offered your appointment to somebody else today and they were able to make it  At      pm I had two patients who I had assessed   yourself and this patient who were both wanting therapy  This patient was able to start  You were not  at that moment  So the appointment slot has gone to this patient   ME  I understand that  I m not expecting for you to prioritise my appointment over anothers  I appreciate it was late notice  When I have had counselling before  a sickness meant the appointment was rearranged  I am unsure of how you work especially in the private sector but wanted to clarity if it was the same  I may have misinterpreted and thought I was taken off your list completely  I m not trying to be rude I just wanted clarification  sorry

241,Three way with Anxiety,1,puhdct,Advice Needed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/puhdct/threeway_with_anxiety/,2,2021-09-24,Hi there   I m having real trouble dealing with my very anxious girlfriend at the moment  I wonder if you guys could share some insight  Particularly if you have ever made a relationship work where one partner has anxiety and the other is the complete opposite  Our context is below   My girlfriend is a successful  smart  beautiful   yo woman with a high octane job  Her non anxiety driven personality is just amazing to be around  She can be so supportive  kind  and thoughtful to me and my family too  But  her anxiety has become a constant theme  and her defence mechanisms can be so unpleasant  dismissive cynical rude behaviour   I try to support her by encouraging her to take a more positive approach  which works for me  but she tends to resist this and arguably it makes it worse  I have gently encouraged her to seek therapy for three years  she decided to start around six months ago and she is definitely putting in the effort  Still  I would say one in every two evenings ends with her employing one of the above defence mechanisms or crying because  everything is her fault   I think she s frustrated that her anxiety isn t  fixed  yet despite six months of therapy  which just adds more to the background level of anxiety   I m a confident   yo man  I struggled with dark depression in my late teens early twenties  so I have a huge amount of respect for mental health issues  but I ve personally been in a stable place for several years  My always on coping mechanism is to maintain a growth mindset and positive attitude  I have personally benefited from years of therapy  which has really developed my own empathy as well as making me an advocate for therapy for others  I m comfortable being honest about what I want  saying what I mean  and apologising when I get things wrong  I sometimes look back at my diaries from that dark period as proof that things can change and it gives me hope  I just want to live a life where my girlfriend and I are happy together   She sometimes raises the subject of marriage and kids   I want both of those things  but I can t imagine building a home with this kind of instability  My parents divorced terribly and hate each other  so if I could do one thing in my life it would be to build a happy home for my future kids  At the back of my mind  I wonder if we will ever get to a place where the life we both want is possible  I also wonder whether I m helping her or making her anxiety worse   What I d really like to know is  how can we go back to loving spending time together when my positivity makes her feel inadequate and her negativity brings me down  Have you done anything in a similar situation that made it better  I m just seeking information and I have a thick skin  so feel free to constructively criticise  I m also happy to give some examples more detail if it s helpful   Thanks very much

about how disgusting that would be to her    About six days ago  while we were out with a group of new friends  I must have unknowingly gone a bit too far and some of these friends asked Amanda why I am so mean to her  which made her very uncomfortable to answer because she didn t know how to explain it    Later that night I also accidentally interrupted her as she made plans to go out to some bars with these friends which I hadn t planned to go on  and in talking to me she told them she d wait for another Uber just to find out that there were no cars available and she couldn t go after all  which made me feel awful because I felt like I had ruined her night  even though she said it was fine and she would just go to bed and get more sleep than she would have otherwise    The next day I texted her again to apologize  when she sent paragraphs explaining how uncomfortable she had been the day before and how she felt that I had gone too far and me made her feel bad about herself with my teasing  I felt terrible and tried again to apologize to which she added that I have made her feel bad when she tells me about guys that she talks to and that she no longer feels comfortable telling me these things because she thinks I am too judgmental and only make her feel bad about it  I admit that I have been very upfront about how I feel about guys she talks to  and I know looking back that I should have been more tactful about it  The reason I am very forward about it is because recently she had been talking to an ex of hers who was awful and verbally abusive to her  which I told her right away I thought was a stupid idea and she should think about getting involved with him again and that I could not bring myself to support her in that    I can see that I made her feel as though I was calling her stupid for what she had done  although in my mind I believed that was the only way to get my point across about how I thought it would end badly and end with her hurt  because we have never been the kind to have a heart to heart with each other and I don t feel like she would take me seriously if I tried to have a serious talk with her about it because that has never been how we talk to each other  I am not trying to be very protective of her because we are not dating  neither of us wants to date the other  and I know she is an adult who can take care of herself  But I do care about her getting hurt and I don t want her to get hurt again  especially by the same person who has done it before    I spent several days trying to text her to talk with her about these issues and she would always tell me that  we can talk in a little bit I have to do X right now  followed by silence until around   or   pm when she would ask if we could do it the next day because it was getting late  which I would agree to because I don t want to push her and give her space if she needs it    We finally talked last night and she said that she is not angry at me and just needed to get some things off her chest  and I explained that I had clearly gone too far without realizing it or realizing how I was making her feel   She said it was ok and that she just needed to cool off a little  which made me feel better  But then today she would still hardly talk to me in class and when I asked her what she was doing this afternoon she said she was tired and wanted to nap  but then immediately agreed to go shopping with another new friend and they ran off together immediately when class ended    This new friend is also a woman and I know Amanda had said that she was excited to have some girl friends because she has usually been friends mostly with guys and I understand that and I m not trying to stop her from making friends and hanging out with them  But to me it feels as though she s just decided to shut me out and essentially replace me with these new friends  She ll hardly talk to me in person  and when I text her she will never respond with more than a sentence and it s always something about how she s doing something with these other friends    I have asked if she needs space and I try not to bother her too much about anything because I still feel like she does not want to talk to me  but she told me that it s all fine and I don t need to leave her alone or anything like that    I am afraid that I ruined my relationship with one of my best friends and even though I try to tell myself that she may just need some space  I am terrified that when I crossed that line  I crossed some point of no return and we may never have the same relationship again 
343,Finally making progress,1,pu7yqt,Progress!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/pu7yqt/finally_making_progress/,0,2021-09-24,For me    M   ever since grade   when I was    I honestly believe I had depression and anxiety  I was always so worried about what everyone thought of me  I always felt awkward and  not normal   and I was never happy  I just thought that s what happened when you hit puberty and started growing up  that all adults felt like that  My anxiety has always been very closely related to the way I look  I have noticed that throughout the years  I always thought that I looked different from everyone else for some reason  and I grew up always being the small and weak kid  Even now when I m much bigger I forget that everyone doesn t look at me like a kid sometimes  On bad days whenever I m feeling anxious  I always think that my face looks weird and my hair looks bad  even though obviously is doesn t look much different than on good days  Whenever I am feeling anxious I lose all my self confidence and self esteem  I start to think my outfits looks bad  On good days however  I think I look good and handsome  and I can tell myself that nobody pays that close attention to how I look other than me  and I m only able to truely believ that when I have my good days    Finally  this summer my entire life changed  I went to the doctor for something I thought was unrelated  and he told me it was a symptom of anxiety  the symptom was super weak and shaky legs   He recommended me to a councillor  and ever since I finally talked to someone about it and acknowledged it  my anxiety has gotten so much better  This whole thing happening in the summer helped a lot because I m always way happier in the summer  Those   months this year were the happiest I had ever been in my life  Then  the first   weeks of college hit  My anxiety started coming back  but in a different shape than before  Now I was just always worried about things  and always felt on edge and shaky  Over the past   weeks now I have kind of worked through it  My anxiety is getting so much better and I m making progress   Obviously I still have bad days  and it can be hard to keep myself positive  For example  today I had no classes at all and I told myself I would sleep in then get homework done and have a productive day  I did sleep in  but I did almost no homework at all  I just felt so on edge all day  and couldn t stop worrying about how I look even though i knew it didn t matter because I would be in my room all day  Still  I find that dresses nicely helps my anxiety so I tried to wear clothes I thought looked good but for some reason with my anxiety I keep overhung it and thinking they look bad when I know they don t   Even though this seems like a post complaining about how bad my anxiety is  it s really meant to be a progress and celebration post because over the past   months I have done so much work to make myself happier and better my anxiety  It just seems negative because today wasn t the best day  but I thought writing about my progress might help  Hopefully this story helps other people too  And if anyone has tips on how to work on my self confidence and stop questioning my looks while anxious please let me know  Thanks
